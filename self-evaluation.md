*I feel pretty good about it I am just confused about how to call these methods in the Terminal. Right now if I type puts decimals.shift in the Terminal, I get an error. I haven't defined the array in the Terminal just in Atom but I'm confused because I thought they were connected.*


# Additonal learning?
